# NASDAQ-crawler

I developed this crawler during a research project at the University of Technology, Sydney. The crawler extracts all financial data of income statements, balance sheets and cash flow statements of over 3000 companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

KNIME was used to implement k-means clustering to compare clusters vs. industries. The research results are outlined in the Journal Paper.
